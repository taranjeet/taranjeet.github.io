I am Taranjeet Singh, and I can help you start your business, build your product, design your system architecture and grow an engineering team. I can also help you in increasing engagement within your company by conducting various events like hackathons, quizzes.

## Open Source

I am an active Open source developer. Some of my major contributions include

* [Evalai](https://evalai.cloudcv.org/), a Cloud-CV Project - I played a key role here in developing the product from scratch to leading its participation in the GSOC and making the onboarding of new users easy. One very notable contribution here is the implementation of [parallelized backend](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI/commit/14d4803f60884fffffdde873f76ae05ff5f2b742), which takes approximately 2 minutes for a submission to be processed in comparison to standard 10-12 minutes taken by [Microsoft Codalabs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/codalab/)

* [Wye](https://pythonexpress.in/), a Python India Project - I was responsible for building dashboards and learning platforms for tutors.

* [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/), a Dropbox Project - I was responsible for setting up a custom linting pipeline for the whole codebase.

## Work Experience

I have worked at Paytm (2015-2017), and Gradeup (2017-2018). I have interned at Schneider Electric (2013) and Fratmart.com (2014).
