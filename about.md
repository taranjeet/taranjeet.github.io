Hi, I am Taranjeet, popularly known as __Tj__. I am an Open Source Contributor, Entrepreneur, Maker, and a Quizzer.

## Startups

I have tried running my own startup twice in college and once afterwards. I was able to launch the product and get some early customers, but failed in operations and scaling. But overall it was a great experience in terms of learning. Here is a little brief about what I was trying to build.

* **Online Aggregator Portal** for offline stores discount and deal in 2012, hyperlocal space. I was able to onboard 40-50 merchant from 5 malls of Noida/Ghaziabad and ran the portal for around 6 months, but failed due to lack of a proper team and capital.

* **Ecommerce Portal** for laptop stickers in 2014. I was able to get 100 orders in 2 months, but failed due to run it operationally due to lack of capital.

* **Social Media Management and Analytics Dashboard** for restaurants in 2017. I was able to bring 10 restaurants onboard within a span of 1 month, but failed to reach product/market fit.

## Open Source

I am an active Open source developer. Some of my major contributions include

* [Evalai](https://evalai.cloudcv.org/), a Cloud-CV Project - I played an key role here in developing the product from scratch to leading its participation in the GSOC and making the onboarding of new users easy. One very notable contribution here is implementation of [parallelized backend](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI/commit/14d4803f60884fffffdde873f76ae05ff5f2b742), which takes approximately 2 minutes for a submission to be processed in comparison to standard 10-12 minutes taken by [Microsoft Codalabs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/codalab/)

* [Wye](https://pythonexpress.in/), a Python India Project - I was responsible for building dashboards and learning platforms for tutors

* [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/), a Dropbox Project - I was responsible for setting up a custom linting pipeline for the whole codebase.

## Experience

### Hackathons

I have a special love towards hackathon. I feel that hackathons are a way to accelerate learning, increase engagement and team building, improve society through technology and helps in assessment of an individual. Here are some of my contributions in regards to hackathon

* **Organized** a day long corporate internal hackathon at Gradeup. I was responsible for everything here, from the problem statement to team creation, from judging criteria to the awards. It was a fun and engaging experience, where some internal tools got created in a day, achievement timeline was made and the whole office got a new look.

* **Judged** a hackathon conducted by GDG Noida at JIIT Noida.

* **Sponsored** Smart India Hackathon 2017, held at JSS Noida via one of my startups. I was also a mentor and judge at this event.
