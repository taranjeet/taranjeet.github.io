However, sunsetted as I was doing it all by myself and failed to raise funds.

* ___[2014 - 2015]___ Developed and managed an E-commerce Store for laptop stickers during the third year of engineering. It provided high quality reusable laptop stickers for college students. 300 orders were placed in 2 months. Sunsetted as the market was small and involved a lot of capital investment upfront.
