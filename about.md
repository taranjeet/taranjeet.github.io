# Hey üëãüèª

I am the first growth engineering hire at KhataBook and learning Growth at [Reforge 2020](https://www.reforge.com/).

Previously, I built a [search engine](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.gradeup.k12&hl=en_IN) for K12 students, featured at [Google IO 2019](https://www.asianage.com/technology/in-other-news/090519/google-io-2019-featured-two-indian-companies-for-excellent-use-of-machine-learning.html). I also built and led a [popular open source](https://evalai.cloudcv.org/) (900+ stars, 450+ forks on Github) alternative to Kaggle, which is being used by organizations like Stanford, CMU, Google AI Research and FAIR.

I helped develop an [educational product](https://www.talkwithmeapp.com/) for people with Autism, being backed by the New Zealand Government Crown Entity.

I co-authored a chapter on _Industrial Applications of NLP in Search_ for [Practical Natural Language Processing](http://www.practicalnlp.ai/). The authors hail from Google AI, Carnegie Mellon, MIT Media Lab and Microsoft Research.

I have also tinkered around with entrepreneurial attempts many times. My most recent attempt was in the creator's space, where I onboarded a youtube creator with 3L subscribers for the product.

In the past, I have worked with high growth startups like Paytm, and large organizations like Open edX, Schneider Electric.

PS: I have a [detailed version](/about-detailed/) of this about page as well.
