<div align="center"><h1> Hello, I am Taranjeet ðŸ‘‹</h1></div>

I am an engineer who knows product and growth. 

I am working as a Senior Product Manager at [Khatabook](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/indias-khatabook-raises-100-million-for-its-bookkeeping-platform-for-merchants/) (YC & Sequoia backed, valued at $600Mn). I was the first growth engineering hire here.

I have learned fundamentals of Product Growth at [Reforge 2020](https://www.reforge.com/).

I have worked as an engineer with
<ul>
    <li>Paytm (listed on Indian Stock Exchange, ~$6Bn market cap)</li>
    <li>Gradeup (acquired by Byjus, valued at ~$23Bn)</li>
    <li>Schneider Electric</li>
</ul>

I helped developÂ [EvalAI](https://eval.ai/)Â from scratch. It gets ~42K monthly visits from ML and AI researchers and practitioners around the world. It has 1400 stars & 600+ forks onÂ [Github](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI). It is used by Stanford, CMU, Google AI Research, Facebook AI Research.

I built and scaled aÂ [search engine](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=883796972040441)Â for K12 students, featured atÂ [Google IO 2019](https://www.asianage.com/technology/in-other-news/090519/google-io-2019-featured-two-indian-companies-for-excellent-use-of-machine-learning.html).

I helped develop anÂ [educational product](https://www.talkwithmeapp.com/)Â for people with Autism. New Zealand Government Crown Entity backs this project.

I successfully ideated, designed and developed products in hyperlocal, ecommerce, foodtech and edtech and onboarded users.

## Open Source Contributions

### NLP

- I have created a [tokenisation module](https://github.com/taranjeet/hindi-tokenizer) for Hindi language. It is useful in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It has 75+ stars and 70+ forks. It gets ~400 monthly user visits.
