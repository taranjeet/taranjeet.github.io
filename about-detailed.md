Currently working as Senior Product Manager at [KhataBook](https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/30/khatabook-seriesa-businesses-bookkeeping-payments/) (YC S18), I was the first growth engineering hire. I learned fundamentals of Product - Growth at [Reforge 2020](https://www.reforge.com/).

I have worked with large organizations including Paytm, Open edX, Schneider Electric and startups like [Gradeup](https://gradeup.co) and [Inclusys](https://inclusys.com).

I successfully ideated, designed and developed products in hyperlocal, ecommerce, foodtech and edtech and onboarded users.

I built and led an [open source project](https://github.com/cloud-cv/evalai) (1K+ stars, 500+ forks on Github) which is used by organizations like Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, Google AI Research, Facebook AI Research. A [company](https://caliper.ai/) is also built around a forked version of it.

I developed ML algorithms for Gradeup School, a search engine for K12 students, featured in [Google IO 2019](https://www.asianage.com/technology/in-other-news/090519/google-io-2019-featured-two-indian-companies-for-excellent-use-of-machine-learning.html).

Here are some details about my initiatives and experiences

## Book Contribution

* Co-authored a chapter on _Industrial Applications of NLP in Search_ for [Practical Natural Language Processing](https://www.amazon.in/Practical-Natural-Language-Processing-Comprehensive/dp/9385889184/). The authors hail from Google AI, Carnegie Mellon, MIT Media Lab and Microsoft Research.

## Open Source Contributions

### NLP

- I have created a [tokenisation module](https://github.com/taranjeet/hindi-tokenizer) for Hindi language. It is useful in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It has 75+ stars and 70+ forks. It gets ~400 monthly user visits.

### EvalAI

- I helped develop [Evalai](https://eval.ai/) from scratch. Evalai is an open source platform for hosting machine learning competitions at scale.
- It gets ~42K monthly visits from ML and AI researchers and practitioners around the world. It has 1400 stars & 600+ forks on [Github](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI).
- I implemented parallelised backend. It reduced the submission evaluation time by 80% in comparison to [Microsoft Codalab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/codalab/). This made the project popular among CMU, Stanford students. Organisations like Facebook AI Research, Google AI Research also uses it.
- Evalai is a participant project under Google Summer of Code(GSOC). I was GSOC mentor for EvalAI in 2017. I was invited to GSOC mentor summit held in Google Mountain View office.

Organized, Judged and Sponsored Hackathons. They are a way to accelerate learning, increase engagement and build team, improve and benefit society through technology and assess an individual.

* [Organized](https://medium.com/@taranjeet/experience-organizing-an-internal-hackathon-4f4a1d78e0f3) an internal hackathon at Gradeup.

Notable outcomes were creation of internal tools, Gradeup's achievement timeline and new look for the whole office. Was awarded by CEO for this initiative.
