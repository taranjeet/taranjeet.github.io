It has been more than 6 months since I started working on **EvalAI**, one of the
GSOC projects of [CloudCV](https://github.com/Cloud-CV), which helps AI
researchers, students and data scientists to collaborate and participate in
various AI challenges. Over this period of time, the project has evolved
beautifully with core contributions from [Deshraj](https://github.com/deshraj),
[Harsh](https://github.com/dexter1691), [Akash](https://github.com/aka-jain),
[Shiv](https://github.com/spyshiv) and
[Rishabh](https://github.com/RishabhJain2018) and
[me](http://github.com/taranjeet).

#### My role in EvalAI

It started with a simple contribution from my side. However, I ended up playing
multiple crucial and interesting roles while actively participating in designing
and developing the whole project, database schema, API design guidelines to
follow, project structure, deciding major code and decision flows and writing
tests.

Everything happened swiftly and the learning graph was exponential. Things took
an interesting turn when I got involved in the code reviewing part. I learned
the skill of interacting with contributors, the importance of having tests
before merging any piece of code and the significance of good documentation.

A lesson that I learned here was

> If something is not clear to the other person even after your explanation, then
> it is you who needs to work on the concepts of that topic.

Meanwhile, I was learning all this, CloudCV got selected in GSOC again and
EvalAI too. And all of a sudden I found myself and
[Deshraj](https://github.com/deshraj) reviewing a lot of pull requests. I must
say that each piece of code that was merged in the master trunk, either taught
me something or became a point of my “**CHECKLIST BEFORE MERGING ANY PULL
REQUEST**”. Thanks to all the
[contributors](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI/graphs/contributors) for
giving me such a great experience

Time passed and our project evolved at a great pace. GSOC results were announced
and [Rishabh Jain](https://github.com/RishabhJain2018) was selected for EvalAI
this year. I must say, he is really hard working and dedicated; we have high
hopes for him!

#### What’s next?

I feel EvalAI gave me a wonderful experience, that too in a very short span of
time. After having worn so many hats, now I feel I should wear the “Community”
hat. Helping first-time contributors onboard quickly on the project is what I am
looking forward to.

One of the interesting areas that I am actively looking forward to is product design, especially from the frontend perspective. We have an awesome designer Akash Jain, who I feel will be my SPOC for this.
A very important thing for which Deshraj and I are really hustling (most of the times figuring out) is setting up organisational values and culture. Being a part of an open source organisation is an amazing thing, but setting up organisational values and guidelines when an organisation is growing is a challenging problem. For this, I feel Harsh, [Dhruv](https://www.facebook.com/dhruv.batra.dbatra) and [Devi](https://www.facebook.com/deviparikh) will help us.

#### Summary

To sum up, my experience till now in CloudCV organisation has been really AMAZING. Thanks, CloudCV for such an opportunity and the ongoing learnings. :)
